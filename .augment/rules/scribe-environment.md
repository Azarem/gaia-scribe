Before doing anything, read AGENTS.md
We do not have the ability to test locally because the OAuth redirect pulls us into production. Assume all work to be done on production. After doing work, make commits using git and wait for the github action to complete. Then once the publish is done, open playwright to scribe.gaia.studio for testing.
