# Scribe - Collaborative Game Database Editor

A modern, real-time collaborative editor for game database management, built with React 19, Supabase, and TypeScript.

## üöÄ Features

- **Authentication**: Email/password and GitHub OAuth support
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live editing with Supabase Realtime
- **Comprehensive Data Models**: Support for game ROMs, projects, files, blocks, strings, and more
- **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with generated database types
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Utilizes React 19's new form features

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
- **Database ORM**: Prisma (with native Supabase PostgreSQL)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router v6

## üéØ Architecture Approach

This application uses **Supabase's REST API** for all database operations along with **Supabase realtime subscriptions** for live updates. We use **Prisma-generated types** for TypeScript safety without any custom viewmodels or transforms, keeping the data layer clean and type-safe.

**Key Principles:**
- **Supabase APIs**: Direct use of `supabase.from('table').select()` for data operations  
- **Realtime Subscriptions**: `postgres_changes` events for live updates
- **Prisma Types**: Generated TypeScript types for compile-time safety
- **No Services**: Direct API calls without additional service layers
- **No Transforms**: Raw database objects with Prisma typing

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account and project

### Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```
4. Run database migrations: `npm run db:push`
